      <dd>I'm a junior and have been RCDT for two years. I did Chinese Dance outside of school and I thought that
      this would be a great way to continue that. It takes too long to travel to my old school, so it's convenient
      that I can still have fun at Rutgers. I also get to learn something different being with different people.
      I get to meet new people and see others learn something that I have been training in for years.
      It is fun to see how others approach something that is outside of their comfort zone.</dd>

      <dd> I'm a junior in the School of Arts and Science and have been part of RCDT for two years.
      I joined RCDT because I have loved Chinese dancing ever since I was little and knew I wanted to continue
      dancing in college. RCDT not only has helped me improve with my dancing, but it has also helped me make many
      new friends that I cannot live without. Besides practices, rehearsals, and performances, RCDT finds time to
      spend with each other and get closer. In addition, through performances, RCDT allows its members to attend
      many school events.</dd>

      <dd>My name is Audrey Dong, a senior in Cell Biology and Neuroscience. I first joined RCDT as a way
      to keep in touch with my culture and get some exercise, and overall to try something new. I stayed with
      RCDT because I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was fun, learning new dances and attending so many events,
      especially since I wouldn’t have known about them otherwise. I think I also trip less often now. Overall,
      I hope you enjoy our performances, and feel free to join! No experience necessary!</dd>

      <dd>Hello! I am a senior at Rutgers Business School and I have been a member of RCDT since my freshman year.
      I joined this organization because I enjoyed learning Chinese dance at my Chinese school prior coming to Rutgers
      and wanted to continue in college.  My past years in RCDT has help me grow as an individual, performer, and leader
      and I don't regret my experience!  Joining this troupe is a great way to make friends, get some exercise, and
      try something new. Feel free to come by at one of our practices if you’re interested.</dd>

      <dd>My name is Leanna Bernstein, and I'm a junior in SAS, studying psychology.
      This will be my third year in RCDT, and I am glad I joined when I did. Originally, I joined because
      the club sounded interesting, and I wanted to learn more about Chinese culture. Upon joining, I quickly
      befriended people in the troupe, which is how I made a lot of friends in my freshman year. It also keeps
      me active during the school year, which is always a good thing. </dd>

      <dd>My major is ITI with a minor in Computer Science and I am currently a junior. 
      The reason why I decided to join RCDT is because I wanted to experience something outside of my own culture. 
      I found that the RCDT community was very inviting which helped me adjust to Rutgers. 
      I also love that RCDT members genuinely care about each other.</dd>

      <dd>I'm a senior and have been in RCDT since my freshman year. I joined because I wanted to try something new.
      RCDT is very friendly and great for any level of experience! The team is full of great people I got to know better
      through weekly practices, performances throughout the semester, and group outings and meals. I'm very glad to have
      them as friends. I hope reading this persuades you to join this family!

      <dd>I am a sophomore in the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy. I was introduced to RCDT by a childhood friend who 
      was a member of the troupe. Despite having no previous experience dancing, I quickly picked up Chinese dance with 
      lots of help from the experienced dancers. My favorite part about RCDT is that the members of many different backgrounds 
      come together to make a welcoming family.</dd>
