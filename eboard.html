      <dd>Hello! I am a junior at Rutgers Business School and I have been a member of RCDT since my freshman year.
      I joined this organization because I enjoyed learning Chinese dance at my Chinese school prior coming to Rutgers
      and wanted to continue in college.  My past years in RCDT has help me grow as an individual, performer, and leader
      and I don't regret my experience!  Joining this troupe is a great way to make friends, get some exercise, and
      try something new. Feel free to come by at one of our practices if you’re interested.</dd>

      <dd>I'm a sophomore and have been RCDT for a year. I did Chinese Dance outside of school and I thought that
      this would be a great way to continue that. It takes too long to travel to my old school, so it's convenient
      that I can still have fun at Rutgers. I also get to learn something different being with different people.
      I get to meet new people and see others learn something that I have been training in for years.
      It is fun to see how others approach something that is outside of their comfort zone.</dd>

      <dd>My name is Audrey Dong, a junior in Cell Biology and Neuroscience. I first joined RCDT as a way
      to keep in touch with my culture and get some exercise, and overall to try something new. I stayed with
      RCDT because I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was fun, learning new dances and attending so many events,
      especially since I wouldn’t have known about them otherwise. I think I also trip less often now. Overall,
      I hope you enjoy our performances, and feel free to join! No experience necessary!</dd>

      <dd>My name is Leanna Bernstein, and I'm a sophomore in SEBS, studying food science.
      This will be my second year in RCDT, and I am glad I joined when I did. Originally, I joined because
      the club sounded interesting, and I wanted to learn more about Chinese culture. Upon joining, I quickly
      befriended people in the troupe, which is how I made a lot of friends in my freshman year. It also keeps
      me active during the school year, which is always a good thing. </dd>

      <dd> I'm a sophomore in the School of Arts and Science and have been part of RCDT for one year.
      I joined RCDT because I have loved Chinese dancing ever since I was little and knew I wanted to continue
      dancing in college. RCDT not only has helped me improve with my dancing, but it has also helped me make many
      new friends that I cannot live without. Besides practices, rehearsals, and performances, RCDT finds time to
      spend with each other and get closer. In addition, through performances, RCDT allows its members to attend
      many school events.</dd>

      <dd>I am a Junior and this is my third year in RCDT! In the beginning of my freshman year a friend of mine who
      was a member of RCDT at the time vaguely told me about a "ribbon dance group" that she was apart of and invited
      me to come to practice with her. So one day I joined her and I've been enjoying Chinese dance ever since. RCDT
      is a great way to make friends, have new experiences, and get in shape all while having fun!</dd>

      <dd>I'm a junior and have been in RCDT since my freshman year. I joined because I wanted to try something new.
      RCDT is very friendly and great for any level of experience! The team is full of great people I got to know better
      through weekly practices, performances throughout the semester, and group outings and meals. I'm very glad to have
      them as friends. I hope reading this persuades you to join this family!
